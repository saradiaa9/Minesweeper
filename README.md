# Minesweeper

Minesweeper is a Haskell-based game where players must clear a grid of hidden mines without detonating them. 

## Installation

To install Minesweeper, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine: `git clone https://github.com/saradiaa9/Minesweeper.git`
2. Install the [Haskell Platform](https://www.haskell.org/platform/) if you haven't already.
3. Navigate to the project directory: `cd Minesweeper`
4. Build the project using the `cabal` command: `cabal build`
5. Run the game using the `cabal` command: `cabal run`

## Usage

To start the game, run the `finalmile.hs` file using the `cabal` command: `cabal run`. This will open the Minesweeper menu, where players can start a new game.

## Acknowledgements

This project was inspired by the classic Minesweeper game, and by the many talented developers who have created similar projects before us. We also want to thank the Haskell community for their support and contributions to the open-source ecosystem.
